# Members Only

A miniature message board. Anyone can sign up and log in to submit new
messages, but only "secret club" members can see the name and timestamp
of each message. "Admin" accounts also have the ability to delete messages.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js with Express
- Mongoose with MongoDB Atlas
- Passport for authentication
- Pug templates
- Bootstrap
- Vanilla JavaScript for some front-end validation

## Learning Outcomes

- Model-view-controller design
- CRUD methods
- Input sanitization & validation
- User authentication and sessions
- Deployment to production

## Passwords

"Join club" to view message author and timestamp:
```
GoodTimes123#
```

"Become admin" to delete messages:
```
AphexTwin123#
```
